# TVB Epilepsy

This project contains prototype code for epilepsy applications of TVB.

Project architecture
====================

This project contains the following packages:
- base
    <br>This package is independent and used by the other packages in tvb-epilepsy. It is holding sub-packages that define models, configurations, logger, computations, symbolic computations etc.

- io
    <br>The I/O functionality is kept here. This package provides readers and writers for various file types, like: h5, csv, rdump, tvb_data format.
    <br>It is mostly used to serialize models from base package in files. It is dependent on base package.

- plot
    <br>Besides keeping data into files, tvb-epilepsy provides plotting functionality under this package.
    <br>There are plot methods for: hypothesis, connectivity, simulation results, epileptor model, fitting results etc.
    <br>It is dependent only on the base package.

- service
    <br>This package provides all the logic of tvb_epilepsy. It contains builders, factories and services.
    <br>Builders can be used to generate objects based on some conditions. There are builders like: hypothesis, model configuration, simulator.
    <br>Factories are used to create instances based on the wanted type (usually string or enum). For example, there are factories for epileptor model, probability distribution.
    <br>Services can be split in two big parts: services that do forward computations (Simulator, LSA, PSE) and services that do backwards computations (Model inversion/fitting).
    <br>These are usually dependent on the base package because they are working with models, logger and computations. In some cases, there are also dependencies on the io package.

- top
    <br>Here there are 2 sub-packages: examples and scripts.
    <br>Inside examples there are main files with different flows that can be used with tvb-epilepsy. As an example, main_vep exemplifies steps for: reading an hypothesis -> generating a model configuration based on it -> configuring a Simulator -> launching a simulation -> plotting the simulation results -> serializing models to h5 files.
    <br>The scrips sub-package contains some helper functions that are used within the main files.
    <br>The package depends on all of the above, as here is where the flow is chosen.

- tests
    <br>Inside this package there are various unit tests implemented for verifying the correctness of the code. They can also be used for tvb-epilepsy guidance, as they are smaller than examples package.
